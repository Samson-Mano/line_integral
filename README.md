# line integral
Code to visualize function F(x,y) in 3D space, heat map, contour lines along with line integral visualization <br/>
I started this project to experiment with 3D Euler rotation soon it evolved to heat map, contour lines and line integral visualization<br/>
Read through Theory_and_backgound_information.pdf for line integral basics <br> </br>

3D euler rotation works perfectly with Gimbal lock :)
